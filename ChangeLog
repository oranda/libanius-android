== 0.4  June 4 2012

 * Removed performance bottlenecks, allowing Libanius to work comfortably with 20,000 quiz items, 
  not just 1,000:

  1. Experimented with various collections to find the fastest ones. E.g. the Java HashMap 
    is faster than the Scala mutable HashMap 
  2. For persistence, moved from using XML (very slow on Android) to a custom format. 
    (Also considered using SQLite, but the paradigm shift for this app would be too great.)
  3. Parsing the custom format uses Android's own StringSplitter rather than the slow String.split()
  4. The writing of the custom format uses a single StringBuilder which is passed to all model objects.
